  - [PR #211](https://github.com/pushandplay/cordova-plugin-apprate/pull/211) - Use NativeStorage for persistance across installs
  - Breaking Change - Instead of directly asking our users to Rate our app, we now handle this flow much better. The first popup will be "Do you like using appName?" If the user says 'Yes' then we ask the user if they would like take a moment and rate our app. If the user says 'NO', We ask the user another question: "Would you mind providing us feedback?" If the user says yes, then we can run a custom callback to handle this such as sending an email. To revert to previous behaviour you can use `simpleMode: true`
  - iOS 9+ now redirects directly to write review
  - iOS 10.3+ now supports In-App Reviews. One limitation to note is you can only prompt the user 3 times per year before it must fallback to the old open review in store. The preference option to disable this feature is called `inAppReview` and defaults to true, this option was previously named `openStoreInApp` and defaulted to false.
